# Location Privacy Protocol

Implementation of a location protcol based on Spatial Bloom Filters. 
The protocol is designed for a secure multi-party computation setting, where the user and the service provider are mutually distrusting,
 and therefore do not want to disclose private information to the other party. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project required you to install the following python-paillier library

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
You will also need the spacial bloom filter class. You can find it here: https://github.com/spatialbloomfilter/libSBF-python
